            <h2 style="margin-left:5%; margin-top:2%"> Black Widow</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:5%">Natasha Romanoff, known as Black Widow, is a master spy, elite assassin, and a key member of the Avengers. Highly intelligent and 
                fiercely independent, she operates with precision and control, always staying one step ahead of her enemies. While she carries the weight of a complex 
                past, she focuses on using her skills for a greater purpose. Loyal, resourceful, and emotionally resilient, she often serves as the bridge between her 
                teammates, balancing logic with compassion.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-left:5%; margin-top:2%"> Abilities</h2>
                <p style="margin-left:5%">Romanoff is a world-class martial artist, acrobat, and weapons expert, trained in espionage from an early age. Her combat skills allow her to take 
                    down enemies far stronger than herself, relying on agility, precision, and deception. A master interrogator and strategist, she can outmaneuver 
                    opponents both physically and psychologically. Armed with custom gadgets, including her Widowâ€™s Bite gauntlets and electrified batons, she is as 
                    deadly as she is efficient in the field.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-left:5%; margin-top:2%"> Backstory</h2>
                <p>Trained in a secretive and brutal spy program, Natasha was molded into a lethal operative before choosing a different path. Recognizing her 
                    potential, a trusted ally offered her a chance at redemption, leading her to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. and later, the Avengers. Though she has no 
                    superhuman abilities, her skills, experience, and unshakable resolve make her an irreplaceable asset. More than just an agent, she is a leader,
                    a friend, and a protector, always willing to put herself on the line to ensure the safety of others.</p>
