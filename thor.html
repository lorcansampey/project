            <h2  style="margin-top:3%"> Thor Odinson</h2>
            <p>Thor, the Prince of Asgard and God of Thunder, is a mighty warrior and protector of both his home realm and Earth. Known for his 
                immense strength, bravery, and royal lineage, he carries himself with the confidence of a god but has grown into a leader who values humility and 
                wisdom. While once driven by pride and the thrill of battle, he has learned the true weight of responsibility, fighting not just for glory but for those 
                who cannot fight for themselves.</p>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p> As an Asgardian, Thor possesses superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and near-immortality. His command over lightning allows him to summon
                 devastating storms and unleash powerful energy blasts. He wields Mjolnir (later Stormbreaker), granting him flight,
                 weather control, and energy projection. He can summon lightning and eventually learns to harness his power without a weapon.</p>
            <h2> Backstory</h2>
            <p>Born to rule Asgard, Thor was once reckless and impulsive, but through trials and loss, he became a true protector. After first 
                arriving on Earth, he formed an unlikely bond with its people, realizing that strength alone does not make a great leader. When cosmic threats emerged, 
                he took up arms alongside the Avengers, defending Earth as if it were his own. Though he belongs to the stars, he has chosen to stand with his allies, 
                proving that even a god can find a home among mortals.</p>
