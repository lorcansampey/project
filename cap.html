            <h2 style="margin-top:3%"> Captain America</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:1%">Steve Rogers, known as Captain America, is a symbol of unwavering courage, honor, and leadership. Born with a relentless
                 determination to stand up for what is right, he embodies the ideals of justice and selflessness. Despite his enhanced abilities, his true strength lies
                in his unshakable moral compass and willingness to put others before himself. As a natural leader, he inspires those around him, not just through his 
                actions on the battlefield, but through the principles he upholds.
            </p>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p> Enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum, Rogers possesses peak human strength, speed, endurance, and agility, making him one of the most formidable 
                combatants in any fight. His reflexes and stamina allow him to outlast and overpower even the toughest opponents. A master tactician and hand-to-hand 
                fighter, he excels in various forms of martial arts and battlefield strategy. His signature vibranium shield serves as both an offensive and defensive 
                tool, capable of absorbing immense impacts and being used with pinpoint precision.
            </p>
            <h2> Backstory</h2>
            <p> Once a frail but fearless soldier, Rogers volunteered for an experimental program that transformed him into the ultimate warrior. Refusing to be just a
                tool of war, he fought for freedom and justice, becoming a living legend. When a new era of threats emerged, his leadership and combat expertise made him 
                a natural fit for the Avengers. Though displaced from his original time, he remains a steadfast protector of humanity, always standing against oppression 
                and never backing down from a fight, no matter the odds.</p>
